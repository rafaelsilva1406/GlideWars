### Tutorial Tips

   - Try climbing (W) and diving (S)
   - Notice the **air trail effects** when moving vertically

2. **Second Minute**: Learn powerups
   - Collect green (health) and colored (weapons) powerups
   - Notice **magnetic pull** when you get close
   - Try flying through cyan **rings** for bonus points

3. **Third Minute**: Practice combat
   - Use weapons (SPACE) to destroy enemies
   - Try **speed boost** (SHIFT/TAB) to dodge
   - Watch your boost energy meter
   - If you find a **drone powerup** (bright green), grab it!

4. **Boss Fight (3:30-4:00)**:
   - Training Drone appears ahead
   - Dodge red/yellow projectiles
   - Shoot when safe (SPACE)
   - Use boost to evade attacks
   - Boss stays in front - you won't fly past it!

## 🎨 Visual Effects

### Atmospheric Clouds

- Decorative only - **no collision**
- Adds depth and immersion
- Subtle opacity (10%) to not obstruct view

### Air Trail Particles

- Only visible during significant vertical movement
- Creates sense of air resistance and speed
- Fades out over 0.5 seconds

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Energy Management
1. **Boost Strategically**: Don't waste boost flying straight
2. **Recharge Often**: Let boost recharge between obstacles
3. **Emergency Only**: Save boost for tight spots and boss fights

### Scoring Strategy
1. **Never miss rings**: Easy +100 points each
2. **Collect all powerups**: Even if you don't need them
3. **Use drone companion**: Let it farm enemy points
4. **Stay alive**: Death resets to checkpoint (may lose score progress)

### Combat Tips
1. **Prioritize survival** over shooting enemies
2. **Use terrain**: Obstacles block enemy projectiles too
3. **Drone companion** is the most valuable powerup
4. **Save ammo**: Don't waste shots, only shoot when enemies are close

### Boss Strategy
1. **Keep moving**: Don't stay in one spot
2. **Watch attack patterns**: Bosses telegraph attacks
3. **Use boost**: Essential for dodging phase 3 attacks
4. **Aim carefully**: Boss has a lot of health
5. **Be patient**: You have until timer runs out

## 🏆 Progression

### Unlocking Continents
1. Complete **Tutorial** → Unlocks **North America**
2. Complete each continent → Unlocks next in sequence
3. Final continent: **Oceania** (hardest)

### Save System

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues
- Close other applications
- Game auto-adjusts quality for WASM builds
- Desktop version runs at full 60 FPS

### Control Issues
- **Mobile**: Virtual joystick auto-appears on touch devices
- **Keyboard**: All keys should work (WASD + arrows supported)
- **Boost not working**: Make sure you have boost energy (check HUD)

### Gameplay Issues
- **Can't find drone**: 35% spawn rate - keep collecting powerups
- **Boss flew past me**: Fixed in latest version - boss matches your speed
- **Too many clouds**: Fixed in latest version - reduced density
